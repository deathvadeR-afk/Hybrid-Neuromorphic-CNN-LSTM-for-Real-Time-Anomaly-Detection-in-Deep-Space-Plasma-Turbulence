# Hybrid Neuromorphic-CNN-LSTM for Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Deep-Space Plasma Turbulence

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a cutting-edge AI system designed to run on low-power edge devices for real-time anomaly detection in deep-space plasma turbulence. The system addresses critical signal integrity issues faced by space missions beyond the heliosphere, potentially reducing data loss from 30-50% to near-zero levels.

## 🧠 Architecture

Our hybrid model combines three complementary approaches:
- **Neuromorphic (SNN)**: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks for ultra-low power edge computing
- **CNN**: Convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction from plasma spectrograms
- **LSTM**: Long Short-Term Memory networks for temporal pattern recognition

## 🎯 Objectives

- Achieve >95% anomaly detection accuracy in simulated deep-space scenarios
- Maintain <1ms inference latency for real-time processing
- Optimize for low-power consumption suitable for space probes
- Generate corrected signals on-the-fly for autonomous operation

## 📊 Datasets

### Real Data Sources
- NASA's Particle-in-Cell (PIC) Simulation of Decaying Turbulence
- ESA Swarm Mission Ionospheric Plasma Variability Data
- ESA Satellite Anomalies Database
